# Power-BI-Dashboard-Project

🚀Created My First Interactive Dashboard in Power BI! 📊
I'm excited to share that I’ve recently learned how to create interactive dashboards using Power BI — and this is my first project! 🙌
I gained a hands-on experience of data visualization, dashboard design, and actionable insights. This “Mobile Sales Dashboard” reflects various KPIs like total sales, quantity, transactions, average price, and even city-wise and model-wise performance — all made dynamic and filterable.

Key highlights:
 ✅ Visual storytelling with real-time filtering
 ✅ Month-over-month quantity trends
 ✅ Rating breakdowns and payment method insights
 ✅ Clean, user-friendly layout with interactive visuals
